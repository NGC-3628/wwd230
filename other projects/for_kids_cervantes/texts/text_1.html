    <h1>Teen banana Skin Inventor</h1>

        Growing up in Istanbul, Elif
        Bilgin used to enjoy walking
        beside the Bosphorus. However,
        Elif noticed that there was more
        and more pollution, like plastic
        bags, in the river. The 14-year-old
        decided to look for a solution.
        At school, Elif learned that bioplastics are more
        environmentally friendly than normal plastics because
        they are made from starch. Starch is found in foods like
        potatoes and bananas. However, she wanted to use an
        organic material that isn't eaten. Then she learned that
        in Thailand, over 200 tons of banana skins are thrown
        away every day, and that's when she got her idea!
        The teen inventor spent two years developing her idea.
        She did a lot of research online and at the library and
        carried out 12 experiments at school and in her kitchen.
        Not all the experiments were successful, but Elif didn't
        give up, and finally, she produced a bioplastic from
        banana skins. She learnt that the bananas are dipped in a 
        special liquid. Then, bananas are placed in a glass and are heated for 30 minutes
        At 16, she won the Science in Action
        Award and the Inspired Idea Award at the Google
        Science Fair. Her invention could help make rivers, lakes,
        and oceans clean again. Since then, Elif has traveled
        the world telling people about her invention and has
        studied science in college so she can continue to make
        a difference in our world.
        After too mnay tryings she finally knew that after heating banana's peel for 30 minutes
        They must be dried and be pressed into a paste. Then, different 
        liquids are added to the paste and the mixture is stirred. 
        The mixture is cooked in an oven and it is made into plastic.
        Thus, she won a price and knowledge.
