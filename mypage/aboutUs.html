            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p> Everything started when Jeremiah Johnson and Jose Cuervo where working together harvesting fruit for the old Jenkins's farm near San Diego. They got along well and sa friendship started. As they were working Jeremiah got a fat-well inheritance and he own some lands. By the other hand, Jose knowing many tricks for the soil they both started a small company. At the beggining they just sow watermelon. They got lot of sweet watermelons to sell. Thus the bussiniess started to grow. Nothing were wasted, there were watermelon sold here and over the border. As seasons passed by more fruits were added as well as more people. 
                Andrea Lopez, a agronoist engineer from Canada was the first in her class to become part of the Bountiful Fruits family. Her knowledge just increase Bountifulness on the soil. Thereby the company changed the name we are characterized for. Currently we sow and harvest many kinds of vegetables. Currently we're working to have handrogenic walnut trees. 
                We're proud to mention we got the first hydroponic vegatables in the region. 
                10 years later, a solid teams of farmes, engineers, sowers and administration staff converge in this great family.
